These ipynotebooks are for the book ["Machine Learning with Spark
by Nick Pentreath"](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/machine-learning-with/9781783288519/).

If you are not familiar with Scala and prefer python you might find these notebooks useful. I'm new to spark so some methods I use might be stupid and inappropriate.
